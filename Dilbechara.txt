In August 2014, India's Fox Star Studios announced it would adapt the novel into an Indian Hindi-language film, with the working title of Kizie Aur Manny. Producer Karan Johar was supposed to produce the film but eventually backed out.[13]

Mukesh Chhabra launched the film in October 2017, making his directorial debut and announcing that it is the film adaptation of John Green's 2012 novel The Fault in Our Stars, with Sushant Singh Rajput as the male lead.[14] In March 2018, A. R. Rahman was confirmed as the music composer. Later, newcomer Sanjana Sanghi was selected opposite Rajput and Sony Music India acquired the music rights, with Amitabh Bhattacharya as lyricist.[15]

Chhabra was suspended from his services after being accused of sexual harassment in October 2018.[16] Eventually he returned, after receiving clean chit from ICC on the allegations. This resulted in the delay of final schedule and completion of post-production.[17]

While the film was initially titled Kizie Aur Manny (transl.â€‰Kizie and Manny), in February 2019 the title was officially changed to Dil Bechara. This was felt to perfectly embody the theme and had been chosen from lyrics penned by Bhattacharya and composed by Rahman as one of the tracks in the film.
